    <h2>What is House Tracker?</h2>
    <p>House Tracker is a project I started working on in October 2019 that aims to digitalize and automate tracking of
      house points at my Residence. I am currently in the prototyping stage and expect to finish it in Winter 2020, after
      which I will pitch the idea to the UCRC (University College Residence Council) and try to get event hosts and
      students who visit events to start using the web app.</p>
