    <h2>What is Winelier?</h2>
    <p>Winelier is a project I worked on during the summer of 2019 and didn't finish due to getting distracted by
      visiting family and school starting. Since then, I have started to refactor the code base and have found a partner
      who is currently enrolled in a math and economics double major who will help me with the business aspect of running
      a winery database business.</p>
